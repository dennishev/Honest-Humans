              <h2>Creed II</h2>
              <p>
                WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR? Recently I went to see Creed 2. It
                wasn’t the greatest movie I’ve ever seen, but something strange
                did happen to me while watching. I had the most intense
                emotional response I’ve ever had while watching a movie. I was
                crying and feeling an intense sense of attachment to what was
                going on. And tbh, it’s really hard to get me to cry. It was as
                if the my life and my inner world, that I hadn’t been able to
                really out into words was being played out on this massive
                screen. It was telling a compelling story, but it was telling me
                my story. I figured out three themes that really popped out to
                me, and helped me, better understand my own life. Why are you
                fighting. What is your name? Create your own legacy. This little
                article is only going to talk about the first one. As a young
                adult, you are faced with your future and the pressure, to
                somehow figure out how to meet your own expectations. You’re
                possibly in the biggest fight of your life. For longest time, I
                was fighting. Choosing specific things because of some
                unconscious reason, that I could vaguely tell you, but there was
                something deeper. In the movie Rocky asks Creed, “Why are you
                fighting?” And he gives him some vague answer and seems unsure.
                This was a repetitive theme throughout the film and I felt like
                I was being asked the same question. I realized, that I wasn’t
                just fighting to have time and financial freedom, but I’m
                fighting to prove something to myself. To really dig deep in
                life, not for something as simple as a better paycheck, or more
                relaxed weekend, but to become victorious over my fears. I’m
                fighting to be better, not better than other people. Better than
                myself. If you haven’t asked yourself this question, maybe it’s
                because you haven’t realized that you are even in a fight. Maybe
                you’ve given the battle up. Maybe you have decided to allow
                complacency to rule your life. In that Theatre, God was asking
                me a question, “Why are you fighting?” To which I really I had
                to search my soul to find out the answer. I want you to find
                your answer because finding mine, has helped me become more
                intentional and understanding of my own life pursuits. It’s
                fueled my flame, and empowered me to fight harder than I ever
                have before. Why are you in this? Sometimes our “why” is fueled
                by our insecurities, and truth be told, it won’t last us through
                the fight of life. We need a why that’s bigger than ourselves.
                Why are you alive? WHAT IS YOUR NAME? Who are you? Often times,
                your last name fills you with pride. It isn’t just a set of
                vowels, consonants and syllables; it’s your family’s mantra
                unexpressed. When I think of my name (Josh King) I think of
                bravery and grit. It gives me identity. The moment I was born, I
                was a King. The thing is, my parents and the people before them
                were the ones who created that identity, that mantra and that
                name. I get to live up to that name, and push the envelope a
                little farther to even tally pass the baton along to the next
                generation of Kings. In the Movie, Creed is asked by a referee,
                “What is your name?” Creed replies, with, “Creed!” And in that
                seemingly routine moment, the whole audience knew that the man
                in that ring, wasn’t just questioning his name, He was asking
                the bigger question we all ask ourselves; he was asking Creed,
                “who are you?” Creed answered with a surge of intense emotion.
                He was answering for his father, his mother, his wife, and his
                baby. He was reminding himself of what being a Creed meant. All
                the history attached to the name, all the emotions attached to
                that name. Your name means more than we think Figure out your
                name. CREATE YOUR OWN LEGACY! Finding your purpose, and making
                it your own. We all need something to fight for, and we all
                should leave our signatures on the geography of our family’s
                map. In Creed 2, there’s a subliminal repetitive theme carried
                throughout the film. It’s this idea that Creed needs to build
                his own legacy, that he is somehow standing in the shadow of his
                father’s unfinished work. I understood that the reason Creed had
                to create his own legacy, and the reason he was in his father’s
                shadow, wasn’t because of a family failure(if you don’t follow
                the movie series, Creed’s father was killed in the boxing ring)
                the reason Creed was in his father’s shadow, was because He
                never picked up where his father left off. He really just ran
                the same race that his father did, but not as far. He hadn’t
                picked the baton up and carried it farther. This movie was
                revealing something inside of me that I didn’t even know was
                there. One of the reasons of why I’m fighting, is because I need
                to create my own legacy. I need to pick up the baton where it
                was left off and bring in farther and carry it in a different
                way. Create your own legacy.

              <h2>Jumpstart</h2>
              <p>
                If you have an area of your life where you are lacking find a
                jump starter Find a person who embodies the epitome of the area
                that you are lacking and get around them; their strength will
                rub off on you and jumpstart that once vacant and dead area of
                your life. I work at a nonprofit. A lot of volunteers work with
                me and many of them have mental disabilities, and although,
                they’re not the best at stacking bunch of boxes in the most
                strategic way, theses people have become my friends. I really
                have come to enjoy my work days because of one person in
                particular. He is the funniest guy ever!! I have recently gone
                through a season where I’ve been more serious and somber. I’m a
                young adult, recently married, and a baby on the way. I’ve got a
                lot on my plate, mostly because I like it that way, but I can
                become more serious as I take my future extremely serious. I
                noticed I was becoming boring. I wasn’t having as much fun. I
                was losing that wonder of life that comes with being young and
                inspired. What I noticed was that, whenever I hang out with this
                guy, Because he is so goofy, It rubs off on me, so much, that I
                become goofy, even after he is gone. This guy, has jump started
                an area of my life that was growing wildly weaker and weaker. He
                has re-lit the fire inside of my goofy side. So now I wonder,
                whenever I have an area of my life, where I’m lacking I can find
                someone who excels in that area, and it will naturally rub off
                on me, just by being around them. Community makes a little more
                sense now. YOU HAVE TO BE OK WITH NOT BEING THE BEST IN EVERY
                AREA OF YOUR LIFE ALL THE TIME. Raise your hand if you’re a
                young adult. If you happen to be young, and also entering that
                infamous stage of adulthood, then you’ve probably encountered
                some type of identity trials. This season has been trying. Not
                because it’s emotionally taxing, but because I’ve been confused
                about some things. Is it ok for me not to be excelling in every
                single area of my life? If it’s not, then how am I supposed to
                go after all that I am passionate about? I have so many things
                that I really want to pursue and I am doing them, but other
                things that I have previously given a lot of life to, are in
                many ways taking a backseat. Since I’m new at pursuing multiple
                areas and attempting at thriving in all of them, I often
                question if it’s ok. There’s a lot to learn. Let’s say you’re
                interested in becoming an entrepreneur or a real estate agent,
                or any sort of semi-promising career paths. These are all going
                to take a lot of time and energy to become great in. And
                Greatness is not an expendable attribute in my book. Naturally
                though, other areas are going to feel lack. I heard Steven
                Furtick talking about this exact thing, but in the context of TD
                Jakes, giving him advice. TD jakes told him, you’re just going
                to have to accept that part of life. It takes time and energy to
                get things going. You do your best to be balanced and manage it.
                This gave me so much peace and reassurement that it’s ok. That
                maybe I’m doing this thing right after all. Please tell me you
                can relate!!!
